I used a CSS rule to style my animation. It is called @keyframes.
-@keyframes is a CSS rule that is used to define animations, it is a rule that allows you to specify the behaviour of an animation.

In this project, i learnt how to use a part of the Selectors Level 4 specifications, the CSS Pseudo-class function :where. It allowed me to group multiple selectors together under a common ancestor in a more readable way.

In this project, i got to use a boolean attribute called "Defer"
This Boolean attribute is set to indicate to a browser that the script is meant to be executed after the document has been parsed.
